Repository for bvmlib versions 1.2 and above

# Others
bvmlib 1.2 and above(new bvmlib) is incompatible with bvmlib 1.1 and below(old bvmlib)
<br>
since the new bvmlib will have a more simple and compact bytecode, (might choose a fixed size 4 bytes instruction)
different interfaces, different internals and more.
